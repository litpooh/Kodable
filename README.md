# Kodable

## Introduction:
In this project the goal is to code a clone of a children game called Kodable. With Kodable kids learn core programming concepts such as sequencing, conditionals, functions, and loops. In essence the game encourages logical thinking. Here is the website of Kodable:

If you have an apple device (IPad or IPhone) you can try to download the application via the app store. You can also try the game directly in the web browser otherwise (after registering). The game is paid, but there is a free trial for a few days. So you can try it out for free for 7 days.
